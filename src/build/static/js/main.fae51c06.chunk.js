The term horse commonly refers only to the domestic Equus caballus and to the wild Przewalski's horse. (Other so-called wild horses are feral domestic horses or their descendants.) Adapted to plains environments, all Equus species, including the ass and the zebra, have lengthened foot bones ending in a single toe covered by a hoof, for fast running; teeth shaped for grinding grass; and intestinal protozoa for digesting cellulose. All species have tufts of hair on the tail, used against insects, and manes on the neck. Horses, zebras, and asses can interbreed, but the offspring are usually sterile. The offspring of a horse and a donkey (domestic ass) is called a mule.","A male horse is called a stallion, or if castrated, a gelding; a female is a mare; her offspring are foals\u2014males are colts, females are fillies. A male parent is a sire, a female parent is a dam. A single foal is born after a gestation of about 11 months. Horses reach sexual maturity in about two years, but are not fully grown for about five years. The average life span is 18 years, but 30-year-old horses are common. The standard unit of height is a hand, equal to 4 in. (10 cm).","The earliest known direct ancestor of Equus, the eohippus [Gr.,=dawn horse], 10 to 20 in. (25\u201350 cm) tall, lived approximately 50 million years ago in both the Old and New Worlds. Equus originally evolved in North America by the late Pliocene epoch, some 4 million years ago (based on DNA sequencing of modern and ancient horses), spreading to all continents except Australia. Horses disappeared from the Americas for unknown reasons about 10,000 years ago, to be reintroduced by Europeans, c.A.D. 1500.","Many species of Equus arose in the Old World. Horses were probably first domesticated by central Asian nomads around 3500 B.C., probably initially for milk and meat. Horses were recorded in Mesopotamia and China (c.2000 B.C.), Greece (c.1700 B.C.), Egypt (c.1600 B.C.), and India (c.1500 B.C.). Horses were domesticated in W Europe no later than 1000 B.C. It is not known whether these early domesticated horses developed from a single wild race or from many local races.","Largely superseding the slower, less manageable ass, which had been domesticated much earlier, the horse's first known use was for drawing Mesopotamian war chariots. It was long reserved primarily for warfare and for transportation for the rich and well-born, while cheaper animals (e.g., oxen, mules, and donkeys) were used for lowlier work. Horses figured importantly in war and conquest in Europe, central Asia, and the Middle East for over 3,000 years. Early warriors rode bareback or with saddle cloths. The saddle and the stirrup were probably developed in China in the early Christian era, spread by Asian horsemen (such as the Huns), and adopted by Arabs and Europeans in the early Middle Ages. Arab cavalry conquered the Middle East and N Africa in the 7th cent. A.D. In the same period, armored knights were riding to battles in Europe. With highly developed cavalry tactics, the Mongols extended their 13th cent. empire from China to E Europe.","The Spanish conquistadors brought horses to the New World, where Native Americans soon acquired them from ranches and missions. The Plains Indians of North America quickly developed a horse culture that led to their ascendancy in numbers and power. Horses were used for hunting buffalo and other game, for warfare, and for pulling loads on a travois. Escaped Indian horses were ancestral to the mustang, the so-called wild horse of the W United States.","The two major groups of modern horses\u2014the light, swift southern breeds, called light horses, and the heavy, powerful northern breeds, called draft horses\u2014are believed to have arisen independently. The small breeds called ponies may derive from a southern, light horse or from a wild race.","During Roman times the Gauls and other Europeans used horses of the heavy, northern type for pulling loads and other work. In the Middle Ages huge draft animals, over 16 hands (64 in./160 cm) high, were bred to carry armored knights as well as their own armor. As cavalry warfare declined, such medieval inventions as the horseshoe and the rigid horse-collar (see harness) made draft horses more useful for work. By the 19th cent. the draft horse had replaced the ox in N Europe and North America. Draft breeds common in the United States were the Belgian, the Clydesdale, the Percheron; and the Shire, also the most common draft horse in England.","Modern light horses, all descended in part from the Arabian horse, the oldest surviving breed of known lineage, include the Thoroughbred, celebrated as a racehorse; the American saddlebred horse, known for its easy gaits; the Morgan and the quarter horse, favored for riding and cow herding; and the Standardbred, or trotter, developed for light harness racing. The Appaloosa and the Pinto, much used in cow herding, are distinguished by their patterned colors. The palomino is not a breed but a color type. Among the small horses are the Shetland pony and Welsh pony. The terms cow pony and polo pony refer to the animal's use rather than its size or breed. Although little used for work today, horses are widely owned for recreational riding and show activities.","Horses are classified in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata, class Mammalia, order Perissodactyla, family Equidae."]},{name:"horse-racing",title:"Horse Racing",content:["Horse racing refers to trials of speed involving two or more horses. It includes races among harnessed horses with one of two particular gaits, among saddled Thoroughbreds (or, less frequently, quarterhorses) on a flat track, or among saddled horses over a turf course with obstacles to be jumped (steeplechase).","Horse races, today popular throughout most of the Western world as well as in other areas, were probably contested as early as 1500 B.C. in Egypt. The roots of harness racing extend back at least to early Greece, where chariot races were a part of the Olympic games. In the Roman era the chariot race became an entertainment for the masses; the Circus Maximus seated over 200,000 spectators. The constant and widespread desire for faster and stronger horses for work, military use, and sport led to the development of several specially bred strains.","In 12th-century England, Henry II mated the offspring of the speedy Arabian stallions bred in the 9th\u201311th cent. with his own powerful mares. The resultant breed drew proud owners into informal wagers and races to determine the superior horses and riders. The first public racecourse opened at London about 1174, and the \u201csport of kings\u201d became a staple of fairs. As early as the 16th cent., prizes were awarded in English racing, but the 12th Earl of Derby originated (1780) the first event held on a sweepstakes basis (whereby the winner \u201csweeps\u201d the stake offered) at his estate in Epsom; known as the Epsom Derby or English Derby, it continues to be held annually.","In the American colonies, horse racing's appeal was evident in the 17th cent. Informal races, often held on busy roads, gave way by century's end to formal contests at racetracks. Although racing waned during the Revolutionary period, it regained popularity afterward, and in 1823 a North-South challenge drew 60,000 spectators to Long Island's Union Course (N.Y.) for a contest of three four-mile heats between two horses.","Steeplechase (the racing of horses over a course with hurdles and shallow water jumps to approximate country riding conditions) became popular in England and Ireland in the 19th cent. The Grand National Steeplechase, held annually since 1839 at Aintree course, Liverpool, England, is the most famous.","Harness racing, begun in the 1830s from the custom of informal carriage races, became very popular in the 1870s, and in 1891 the modern low-wheel sulky replaced the high-wheeler. Harness racing features two differently gaited standardbred horses\u2014pacers (laterally gaited), which move with a swaying motion, bringing the right front and right hind legs forward at the same time, and trotters (diagonally gaited), which move with a high-stepping, straight ahead gait with left front and right hind legs moving forward in unison. Harness racing, formerly a favorite event mainly at U.S. country fairs, became increasingly popular after World War II at racing centers near urban areas. The United States Trotting Association (formed 1938) governs the sport. Notable harness races include the Hambletonian, the Kentucky Futurity, and the Little Brown Jug.","The first major thoroughbred racing in the United States was at the Saratoga Springs, N.Y., track (1863). Churchill Downs, at Louisville, Ky., opened its flat-racing track in 1875; other thoroughbred tracks soon appeared across the country. At that time, jockeys were often African Americans, but whites forced them from the saddle and effectively denied them riding opportunities until the latter part of the 20th cent., when Latin Americans and women also became some of the top jockeys. The Thoroughbred Racing Associations (founded 1942) is the leading regulatory organization in racing, but state racing commissions oversee racing within their borders. The use and abuse of drugs with racehorses, both for treating and masking pain and enhancing performance, has been a chronic problem in modern horse racing.","Historically the three most important U.S. flat-racing events (all limited to three-year-old horses) have been the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, the Preakness at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, and the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park, on Long Island near New York City. Together these events are known as the Triple Crown, and such winners of all three as Citation (1948) and Secretariat (1973) are considered among the greatest horses in all racing. Since 1984 they have shared the limelight with the annual Breeder's Cup championship, a one-day event comprising seven races of differing conditions held at a premier course. Other important thoroughbred races include the St. Leger Stakes (Great Britain), Queen's Plate (Canada), Melbourne Cup (Australia), Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini (Argentina), Japan Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (France), Preis von Europa (Germany), and Dubai Classic (United Arab Emirates).","Gambling has accompanied horse racing from the beginning, and persists despite attacks by reform groups and religious leaders. In the United States, various states, recognizing an opportunity for increased revenues, began legalizing and taxing betting at the track in the 19th cent. American tracks now use the parimutuel system of wagering, invented in France in the 1860s. All bets are pooled, the odds are based on the relative amounts bet on the horses, and wagering is on whether a horse will win, place (finish second), or show (run third). Some states now also operate facilities for off-track betting (OTB)."]},{name:"polo",title:"Polo: History and Rules",content:["Polo is an indoor or outdoor ball and goal game played on horseback.","Two teams of four compete on a level, rectangular grass field that measures 200 by 300 yd (182.88 by 274.32 m). Safety zones surround the playing field, and at either end goal posts stand 10 ft (3.05 m) high and 24 ft (7.32 m) apart. An indoor version is tailored to the dimensions of the various arenas in which it is played. The outdoor ball, weighing about 4 1/2 oz (.13 kg) and measuring not more than 3 1/4 in. (8.26 cm) in diameter, is made of wood, often willow root. Standard polo equipment includes a specially made brimmed helmet, a flexible-stemmed mallet some 4 ft (1.22 m) long, and the usual equestrian equipment.","An outdoor match is made up of eight periods (called chukkers), usually of 7 1/2 min each, though in some matches either the length or number of chukkers may be reduced. Play is directed toward hitting the ball through the opponents' goal. A mounted umpire metes out penalties\u2014e.g., automatic goals, free shots on goal, and disqualification\u2014for dangerous riding, carrying the ball, or illegal use of the mallet. The umpire starts each period and begins play after each goal by throwing the ball into a marked-off midfield area between the two lines of opposing players. A system of handicapping players promotes parity.","Polo ponies, actually standard-size horses of no particular breed, undergo a long, rigorous period of training to prepare them for the bruising requirements of the game. Because a typical polo match involves virtually nonstop action and many high-speed collisions of the horses, each player must maintain a \u201cstring\u201d of expensive ponies so as to be able to change mounts several times during the course of a match. Thus, polo is a sport for the wealthy.","Some historians claim that polo originated in Persia in the 6th cent.; it spread to Turkey, India, and Tibet and, with some modifications, to China and Japan. According to this view, it was revived in India during the 19th cent., where it became popular with British army officers stationed there, and spread to other countries. Others contend that the British officers themselves created the game (1862) after seeing a horsemanship exhibition in Manipur, India. The sport was introduced into England in 1869, and seven years later sportsman James Gordon Bennett imported it to the United States. After 1886, English and American teams occasionally met for the International Polo Challenge Cup. Polo was on several Olympic games schedules, but was last an Olympic sport in 1936. Polo is also now popular in Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand, but the relative number of polo players remains small."]},{name:"caspian-pony",title:"Caspian Ponies: The Oldest Breed of Domestic Equine",content:["The Caspian may possibly be the oldest breed of domestic equine in existence, according to genetic research done by Dr. Gus Cothran at the University of Kentucky, and may hold an ancestral position to all modem Oriental horse breeds.","There are approximately 500 Caspians in the world, located in their native country of Iran, as well as in England, France, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. A number of these, representing most bloodlines available outside of Iran, are owned and bred by members of the North American Caspian Society. The International Caspian Society, based in England, produces an international studbook with registrations from every country.","In recent years, Caspians have nearly become extinct. Louise Firouz, an American living in Iran, has worked for decades to save the Caspian in its native country, as well as to establish herds elsewhere. In the early 1970s, Louise presented a pair of Caspians to HRH Prince Philip. More exports from Iran to England followed, and some of those Caspians were then sent to Australia and New Zealand.","The story of the Caspian in America began in 1966, when Kathleen McCormick and Louise Firouz co-founded the North American Caspian Society and Louise sent the stallion Jehan from Iran to Kathleen's farm in Virginia. Jehan stood at stud for many years, siring many quality hunter ponies. Due to economic and political barriers, Kathleen and Louise were unable to bring another Caspian from Iran and, unfortunately, Jehan died without siring any purebred offspring. In order to preserve Jehan's line, Kathleen bred him to quality pony mares. This spring, part-bred daughters and granddaughters of Jehan will be bred to Cheleken Zealandia, imported from New Zealand in 1998 and sired by a pure Caspian stallion that is the New Zealand Pony Society's Progeny Award winner. Kathleen also stands Jehan's part-bred son, Jehad, now 29 years of age. In the mid-1990s, Sisters at the Monastery of St. Clare, in Brenham, Texas, imported a shipment of seven Caspians from England. Interest has multiplied in the United States, and subsequent imports have come from England, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand. There are now Caspians in several states around the country, including Virginia, Florida, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.","Though usually referred to as a horse, records indicate that Caspians range in height from under 10 hands to over 13 hands. The Caspian's gait is smooth and its stride is long, more typical of horse than pony breeds. The Caspian's jumping ability can only be described as extraordinary. Slim, refined, strong-boned, with almond-shaped, expressive eyes; the Caspian is distinctive and unique. They have the capability to excel in all equestrian disciplines, from children's mounts to driving in harness. The athletic ability of the Caspian has not yet been fully appreciated. Over the last three decades, the main priority for breeders has been to secure the future of the breed. The expanding sport pony market should provide a demand for the Caspian, as well as the part-bred Caspian.","Members of the North American Caspian Society will also breed Cheleken Zealandia to Thoroughbred, Warmblood, and larger pony mares as part of a secondary-breeding program. These crosses will produce elegant and refined sport ponies with true horse proportions. These part-Caspians are expected to have the movement and jumping ability of the Caspian, with a bit more height and size than the purebreds. The Thoroughbred-Caspian cross has proven successful in New Zealand, where Cheleken Zealandia's half brother is one of the top large hunter ponies in the country.","Currently, The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy classifies the Caspian as critical. This is actually a positive classification when compared to the alternative. This classification of critical means \u201cfewer than 200 annual North American registrations and an estimated global population of less than 2000.\u201d"]},{name:"horses-zebras-asses",title:"Horses, Zebras, and Asses",content:["Herds of horses, asses, or zebras thundering across wide, open plains capture the imagination like few other sights. They conjure up an impression of power and grace, wildness and freedom. Yet such scenes may soon become mere memories, if the conservation initiatives that have been implemented to stabilize precarious equid populations are not taken further. Moreover, by preserving the landscapes that wild equids inhabit, these conservation efforts are also benefiting numerous other threatened species that share the equids' ecosystems.","Few taxonomic groups have such a richly documented evolutionary history as the equids. The earliest of the horselike ancestors, Hyracotherium, appeared in the Eocene, about 54 million years ago. This small, dog-sized mammal browsed on small shrubs and had low-crowned teeth without the complex enamel ridges of modern equids. Its hindfeet had already lost two toes and its forefeet one, but they were still covered with soft pads. Although these small ancestors appeared throughout the northern hemisphere, the subsequent evolution of horselike mammals was centered in North America, with periodic migrations to Eurasia, Africa, and South America. By the Oligocene, 34 m.y.a., large three-toed equids such as Mesohippus and Miohippus appeared. Not only did they bear much of the increased weight on the middle digit: their premolars became more like molars. It was only when grasses appeared, in the Miocene 20 m.y.a., that equids began to radiate. Side toes were further reduced, and continuously growing teeth with high crowns, complex grinding ridges, and cement-filled interstices evolved with the opening up of the habitat and the emergence of tougher forage. By about 5 m.y.a., one-toed, horse-like grazers appeared, first in the form of Pliohippus and then as Equus, today's only surviving genus.","At this point, the center of evolution shifted from the New World to the Old, where the modern species of zebras and asses appeared. As environments changed, populations became isolated, adapting to local circumstances and giving rise to most of today's living species.","The first species to diverge from the earliest true horses were the asses. They were followed by the zebras, with the Grevy's zebra emerging before either the mountain or plains zebra or the quagga (E. quagga, which was driven extinct at the end of the 19th century). The only species that probably did not originate in geographic isolation was the ancestor of the domestic horse, which is thought to be directly descended from some mutant Przewalski's horses. Although all species continued to thrive throughout the Pleistocene, horses had vanished from the American plains by the end of the most recent ice age, perhaps as a result of the arrival of humans from Asia or of changing climates, or maybe a combination of both. Horses were reintroduced to the Americas, with the arrival of European colonists.","All equids are medium-to-large-sized herbivores with long heads and necks and slender legs that bear the body's weight only on the middle digit of each hoofed foot, providing a springy movement. They possess both upper and lower incisors that clip vegetation and a battery of high-crowned, ridged cheek teeth that are used for grinding grasses.","The four features that seem to have contributed most to equid ecological success and broad geographic range are the springy gait, grinding teeth, large size, and the lock position in their legs that enables them to rest. This stay apparatus allows the legs to lock without muscular contraction, which dramatically lowers the energetic costs of resting, feeding, and scanning for predators \u2013 all-important but time-consuming activities. By decreasing relative, or weight-specific, nutritional demands, large size not only enables equids to forage as generalists, but also reduces the cost of transport, allowing them to range economically.","Horses' ears are moderately long and erect, but can be moved to locate sounds and to send visual signals. A mane covers the neck; it falls to the side in domestic horses, but stands erect on the other species. All equids have long tails, covered by long hair in horses and by short hair only at the tip in asses and zebras. The most striking distinguishing feature between species is coat color; zebras have the most dramatic livery, while the coats of horses and asses are more uniform in color.","The species differ somewhat in size, males being generally 10 percent larger than females. Males also possess large canines, suggesting that male\u2013male combat for mating opportunities has been sharpened by sexual selection.","Horses' moods are often indicated visually by changes in ear, mouth, and tail positions. Smell helps individuals keep track of the movements of neighbors, since urine and feces bear social odors. Males use the \u201cflehmen\u201d or lip-curl response to assess the sexual state of females. Yet most social contact takes place through sound. In horses and the plains zebra, foals whinny when separated from their mothers and mothers nicker to warn foals of danger. Males often nicker to declare their interest in a female and squeal to warn competitors that further conflict is imminent. In fact, in horses, the squeals of dominant and subordinate males differ. Those of dominants are 50 percent more drawn out, and tend to end with broad notes rather than with the pure-tone whistles characteristic of subordinates. But the key difference occurs at the onset of the squeal; dominants can instantly hit high-frequency notes, whereas subordinates cannot. This suggests that dominants can exhale air more forcefully than subordinates; sound thus becomes an indicator of superior aerobic capacity, warning other males not to escalate bravado into a real fight. In asses and Grevy's zebra, males often bray when fighting or calling to each other over long distances.","The plains zebra occupies the lushest environments of any wild equid \u2013 the grasslands and drier savannas of East Africa, from Kenya to the Cape. The mountain zebra is confined to two mountainous regions of southwest Africa where vegetation is abundant. The remaining species live in more arid environments with sparse vegetation. Przewalski's horse inhabited the semiarid deserts of Mongolia, while the Asian wild ass is found in the most arid deserts of central Asia and the Near East. The African wild ass, the least horselike of the equids, roams the rocky deserts of North Africa. Generally, the ranges of the species do not overlap, the only exception being Grevy's and the plains zebra, which coexist in the thorny scrub of northern Kenya.","All equids forage primarily on fibrous foods. Although horses and zebras feed mainly on grasses and sedges, they will eat bark, leaves, buds, fruits, and roots, all of which are common fare for the asses, when these are sparse. In equids the microorganisms such as bacteria and protozoa that break down plant cell walls are housed in the saclike cecum. Food is fermented after passing through the stomach, so the passage rate of vegetation is not limited as it is in the ruminant grazers, enabling equids to consume large quantities of low-quality forage, and to sustain themselves in more marginal habitats and on diets of lower quality than ruminants. Even when vegetation grows rapidly, equids forage for about 60 percent of the day, or up to 80 percent when conditions worsen.","Water plays a critical role in shaping the daily, seasonal, and ranging activities of equids. Individuals of all species need to water once a day, nursing young foals more frequently. In fact, the specific watering needs of females of different reproductive states generate different ranging and association patterns among the arid and mesic-adapted species. In arid areas the best feeding sites often become widely separated from watering points. As a result, lactating and nonlactating females of the asses and Grevy's zebra are forced to split off from the herd for parts of the day. In the more mesic areas, food and water are never so far apart.","The interactions that equids have with other species are varied. Ranges rarely overlap, but when sympatry does occur, as happens for some populations of Grevy's and plains zebras, competition for forage appears, but it is subtle. Since microhabitat differences separate the lactating females of these species \u2013 only lactating Grevy's females remain on the grazing lawns near water \u2013 these females have a foraging refuge. Although these areas are limited in expanse, nursing females are able to rear their young in them free from competition. Their more numerous, nonlactating counterparts, however, must search more widely for forage, and in doing so come into contact with plains zebras, which are more efficient at foraging as well as even more abundant. Since both species are drawn to the best swards of grass, the bite rate of nonlactating Grevy's females is sufficiently depressed to lower bodily condition and reproduction, thus ultimately restricting the species' geographic range to the most arid grasslands.","The relationship of equids to similarly sized ruminant grazers can involve coexistence, competition, or even facilitation. The relationship between plains zebras, wildebeest, and Thomson's gazelles typifies the diverse nature of these interactions. When grasses are growing, slight differences in clipping styles and mouth size provide enough dietary separation to minimize competition. But as habitats dry out and grass growth ceases, the zebras' need for large amounts of forage drives them from the higher plains to the moister, more dangerous valleys, where tough forage is plentiful. As they consume the taller, more fibrous material, the softer, more nutritious green leaves appear. By opening up the habitat, zebras facilitate coexistence with the more selective ruminants that need higher-quality vegetation. Nevertheless, under conditions of severe drought or overgrazing, forage can become so limited that wildebeest, Thomson's gazelles, and the other bovids exploit their more efficient rumen fermentation system to outcompete the equids. This argument has been used to explain why grazing equids declined in abundance during the Pleistocene when similarly sized bovids radiated. Yet little direct evidence supports this hypothesis, and a more modern view is that the evolutionary replacement may have been more the result of changing vegetation characteristics than comparative fermentation efficiency."]},{name:"social-behavior",title:"Equids: Social Behavior",content:["Equids are highly social and exhibit two basic patterns of social organization. In one, typified by the two horse species as well as the plains and mountain zebra, adults live in groups with a permanent membership, consisting of a male and a few females that remain in the same harem throughout their adult lives. Each harem has a home range that overlaps with those of neighbors. The second social system, typified by the asses and Grevy's zebra, involves more ephemeral adult associations rarely lasting longer than a few months. Temporary aggregations of one or both sexes are common, but most adult males live alone in large territories. For Grevy's zebra these vary in size from 2\u201310sq km (0.8\u20133.9sq mi), but for asses they measure up to 15sq km (5.8sq mi). Within territorial boundaries, which are marked with large piles of dung, owners get exclusive mating access to receptive females that roam through them. In both systems, surplus males live together in bachelor groups.","Social systems involving temporary groupings and solitary territorial males occur in drier habitats where resources are distributed patchily and where water and the best feeding areas become separated. With lactating females unable to associate on a continuing basis with their nonlactating counterparts, the social cohesion so evident in the mesic-adapted species becomes disrupted. Given that receptive and sexually active females populate both types of female groupings, males compete for control of exclusive areas that either control the major travel routes to and from water if they are dominant, or are far from water, containing the best forage if they are not. Only larger, more evenly distributed resources in which food and water occur near each other allow females of differing reproductive states to travel together in permanent groups, thus enabling harems to form.","Mammal groups are typically formed of close female kin, as daughters remain with their mothers, but in equids groups are composed of non-relatives, since both sexes leave their natal area. Females emigrate when they become sexually mature at about two years old, and neighboring harems, or bachelor males, attempt to steal them. Males disperse by the fourth year to form bachelor associations. Only after a number of years in such associations are males able to defend territories, steal young females, or displace established harem males. Less-able males leaving bachelor groups often form alliances with other similarly ranked males, thereby gaining some mating success.","The relationship between males and females that develop in the harem-forming species is also special. Typically, harems form when closed membership groups of females coalesce because some foraging or antipredator benefits accrue from doing so. In horses and plains zebras, however, females come together because males provide material benefits: increased time for foraging, greater protection for the young, and less sexual harassment. Minimizing strife creates a social stability that is vitally important for female welfare, ultimately allowing them to increase their reproductive success. Since males vary in their ability to provide these benefits, females are choosy, and may vote with their feet by changing groups.","In plains zebra societies, harem groups themselves often coalesce to form herds, sometimes joining with 50 or more bachelor males. This multileveled social organization is more characteristic of primates like geladas or savanna baboons than it is of ungulates. Such complex societies tend to form in plains zebras and not in horses, which also live in harems because bachelor male groups in plains zebras are larger than those of horses. Although dense stands of vegetation often draw harems in both species together, the heightened pressure felt by plains zebra stallions when trying to keep increased numbers of sexually interested bachelors away from their females has induced them to come together and form coalitions to drive the bachelor males away. On landscapes where bachelor males are few in number herds tend to be small, whereas on those where bachelor associations are large herds tend to be composed of a large number of harems. It appears that heightened predation pressure on plains zebra bachelors is ultimately responsible for why they live in larger groups than their horse counterparts.","Mares usually bear only one foal. Only in the Grevy's zebra does gestation last more than a year; since females come on heat 7\u201310 days after bearing a foal, mating and birth occur during the same season, coinciding with renewed vegetation growth. Reproductive competition for receptive females is keen among males. It begins with visual displays of head shaking, neck arching, or foot stamping, or with ritualized bouts of defecating and sniffing, or even with squealing. It is not uncommon for contests to escalate, with animals pushing, rearing, and biting at one another's necks, tearing at \u201cknees,\u201d or kicking their hind-legs into their opponents' faces and chests. In contrast, amicable activities like mutual grooming cement female relationships. There are, however, dominance hierarchies among females also, and high rank confers benefits, including first access to water and superior vegetation.","The young are up and about within an hour of birth. They start grazing within a few weeks, but are generally not weaned for 8\u201313 months. Females can breed annually, but most miss a year because of the strains of rearing foals.","Of the 20 equid subspecies identified at the start of the 20th century, 3 are now extinct and 13 threatened. Although no Przewalski's horses were seen in the wild after 1968, recent reintroductions from the world's zoos have been successful and a number of small but expanding populations in Mongolia are thriving.","Many feral populations of domestic horses are treated as vermin. Selective removals, adoption programs, and female fertility control are pursued aggressively to preserve rangelands and minimize competition with livestock minimized. As for zebras, only the plains zebra is plentiful and occupies much of its former range, but even it is under threat from humans. Mountain zebra populations are already small, yet protected in national parks, but those of Grevy's zebra have fallen drastically, since their beautiful coats fetch high prices.","Even in the Serengeti, which supports large populations of plains zebras, numbers fell by some 40 percent during the 1990s. The estimated annual off-take of about 13 percent is clearly not sustainable. On unprotected lands the problem is often worse, since growing human populations bring settlements, crops, and livestock ranching.","Only by breaking the cycle of poverty and political instability can zebras and other equids hope to coexist with humans. Engaging communities and enabling them to benefit economically from wildlife enhances the value of sharing landscapes with zebras. Wildlife viewing and limited cropping may point the way forward for sustainable zebra management, generating income as an incentive to protect the species. Models have shown that, for most zebra populations, 6 percent of the animals can be harvested per year to maintain stable numbers. Equids are resilient, upping their birth rate and lowering their age of sexual maturity when populations are depressed, so increasing effective genetic population sizes. A further source of genetic diversity comes from the fact that most adult males breed. With their powerful hold on people's imagination and their good fortune in inhabiting areas of natural beauty, wild equids will hopefully prove a major faunal attraction."]}],b=function(){return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("h1",null,"Articles"),r.a.createElement(f,{articles:g}))},y=t(5),w=t.n(y),v=t(9),k=t(11),E=function(e){var a=e.comments;return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("h3",null,"Comments:"),a.map((function(e,a){return r.a.createElement("div",{className:"comment",key:a},r.a.createElement("h4",null,e.username),r.a.createElement("p",null,e.text))})))},A=function(e){var a=e.articleName,t=e.upvotes,n=e.setArticleInfo,s=function(){var e=Object(v.a)(w.a.mark((function e(){var t,r;return w.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(a,"/upvote"),{method:"post"});case 2:return t=e.sent,e.next=5,t.json();case 5:r=e.sent,n(r);case 7:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}();return r.a.createElement("div",{id:"upvotes-section"},r.a.createElement("button",{onClick:function(){return s()}},"Add Upvote"),r.a.createElement("p",null,"This post has been upvoted ",t," times"))},T=function(e){var a=e.articleName,t=e.setArticleInfo,s=Object(n.useState)(""),o=Object(k.a)(s,2),i=o[0],l=o[1],h=Object(n.useState)(""),d=Object(k.a)(h,2),c=d[0],m=d[1],u=function(){var e=Object(v.a)(w.a.mark((function e(){var n,r;return w.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(a,"/add-comment"),{method:"post",body:JSON.stringify({username:i,text:c}),headers:{"Content-Type":"application/json"}});case 2:return n=e.sent,e.next=5,n.json();case 5:r=e.sent,t(r),l(""),m("");case 9:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}();return r.a.createElement("div",{id:"add-comment-form"},r.a.createElement("h3",null,"Add a new comment"),r.a.createElement("label",null,"Name:",r.a.createElement("input",{type:"text",value:i,onChange:function(e){return l(e.target.value)}})),r.a.createElement("label",null,"Comment:",r.a.createElement("textarea",{rows:"4",cols:"50",value:c,onChange:function(e){return m(e.target.value)}})),r.a.createElement("button",{onClick:function(){return u()}},"Add Comment"))},q=function(){return r.a.createElement("h1",null,"404: Page Not Found")},z=function(e){var a=e.match.params.name,t=g.find((function(e){return e.name===a})),s=Object(n.useState)({upvotes:0,comments:[]}),o=Object(k.a)(s,2),i=o[0],l=o[1];if(Object(n.useEffect)((function(){(function(){var e=Object(v.a)(w.a.mark((function e(){var t,n;return w.a.wrap((function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,fetch("/api/articles/".concat(a));case 2:return t=e.sent,e.next=5,t.json();case 5:n=e.sent,console.log(n),l(n);case 8:case"end":return e.stop()}}),e)})));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}})()()}),[a]),!t)return r.a.createElement(q,null);var h=g.filter((function(e){return e.name!==a}));return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("h1",null,t.title),r.a.createElement(A,{articleName:a,upvotes:i.upvotes,setArticleInfo:l}),t.content.map((function(e,a){return r.a.createElement("p",{key:a},e)})),r.a.createElement(E,{comments:i.comments}),r.a.createElement(T,{articleName:a,setArticleInfo:l}),r.a.createElement("h3",null,"Other Articles:"),r.a.createElement(f,{articles:h}))},C=function(){return r.a.createElement("nav",null,r.a.createElement("ul",null,r.a.createElement("li",null,r.a.createElement(c.b,{to:"/"},"Home")),r.a.createElement("li",null,r.a.createElement(c.b,{to:"/about"},"About")),r.a.createElement("li",null,r.a.createElement(c.b,{to:"/articles-list"},"Articles"))))},x=(t(37),function(e){Object(h.a)(t,e);var a=Object(d.a)(t);function t(){return Object(i.a)(this,t),a.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(l.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return r.a.createElement(c.a,null,r.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},r.a.createElement(C,null),r.a.createElement("div",{id:"page-body"},r.a.createElement(m.c,null,r.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/",component:u,exact:!0}),r.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/about",component:p}),r.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/articles-list",component:b}),r.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/article/:name",component:z}),r.a.createElement(m.a,{component:q})))))}}]),t}(n.Component));Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));o.a.render(r.a.createElement(r.a.StrictMode,null,r.a.createElement(x,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[24,1,2]]]);
